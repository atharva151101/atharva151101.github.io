Hi! I am Atharva Chougule. Currently I work as a Software Engineer at Rubrik in their Platform team. I work on [Rubrik Security Cloud Private(RSC-P)](https://www.rubrik.com/products) a product used by large federal and government customers that is often deployed in highly secure air-gapped networks. Previously, I also interned at Rubrik in the [Rubrik Cloud Vault](https://www.rubrik.com/products/rubrik-cloud-vault) team before joining full time. 

I pursued my Bachelor of Technology in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/index.php) at Indian Institute of Technology Madras, where I graduated top of my class and recieved the [B.Ravichandran Memorial Award](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/awards_details.php?arg=Mjk=) for the same. I did my Undergraduate Thesis on code generation for distributed algorithms on dynamic graphs under [Prof. Rupesh Nasre](https://cse.iitm.ac.in/~rupesh/). Previously, I have also work with [Prof. John Augustine](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~augustine/index.html) on problems related to byzantine fault tolerance in a distributed network. 

I have had a lot of fun exploring Distributed Systems, Security, Compilers and Operating Systems through my various experiences. In my leisure time, I love to play football and tennis, or spend time reading books. I also love hiking and travelling.
